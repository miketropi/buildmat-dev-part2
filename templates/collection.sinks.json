Both our stainless steel single bowl inset sink and double inset sinks are available.<br\/><br\/>Our sinks are also designed to be an undermount sink, either undermount single bowl or undermount double bowl this is a more costly exercise and we always recommend that you plan your sink a lot earlier than usual because it is better to provide the sink to the cabinet maker so that there are no mistakes when doing the sink cut out. Make sure if you're designing your kitchen around the benchtop that you look for an undermount sink without a taphole because it is more elegant and having the tap sit on the bench makes for a better feel.<br\/><br\/>Another style that people like to use is the flush mount style, but make sure you have a conversation with your stonemason before deciding because it's very hard to get right and might end up as a costly activity, but if you're able to pull it off nothing can beat the style. Either single bowl sinks or double bowl sinks will work for a flushmount, but we'd avoid putting in a drainboard for a flushmount style.<\/p>"
